# Uber-Rides-Analysis

Our project looks at Uber data to learn about how people travel in cities. We want to find out when and where people use Uber the most. By studying this data, we hope to help make city travel better and more efficient

Steps to Run the Project:

Clone the Repository:
Begin by cloning the project repository from the provided GitHub link. You can use Git to clone the repository locally to your machine.

Prepare Datasets:
Obtain the ride-sharing dataset from the provided source https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record- data.page . Ensure you have access to the dataset files in a compatible format such as CSV or Parquet.

Accessing Databricks:

Log in with your credentials to access the Databricks environment.

Upload Dataset to Databricks:
Within the Databricks workspace, locate the "Data" tab or equivalent where you can upload files.
Upload the ride-sharing dataset file (e.g., CSV, Parquet) into the Databricks environment. This will make the dataset accessible for analysis.

Import Notebooks:
In Databricks, create a new notebook or import existing notebooks from the cloned repository.
To import notebooks, click on the "Import" button and choose the notebook file from your local directory.

Executing Notebooks:
Open the data_processing.ipynb notebook first.
Follow the instructions and execute each cell sequentially to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation tasks.
Next, open the TripDataAnalysis.ipynb notebook.
Execute the cells in this notebook to conduct analysis, generate visualizations, and derive insights from the processed data.
